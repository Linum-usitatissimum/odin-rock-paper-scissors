## Overview

Rock Paper Scissors is an ancient game, thought to possibly originate during the Han dynasty.

Here I'll be adding my Screenshot of the game I have created when it is finished.

### Rules of the Game

Rules of the game are as follows:

You play against the computer.

You press one of the following buttons: 

- the 'rock' button,
- the 'scissors' button,
- or the 'paper' button.

When you press the button of your choice, the computer will randomise their own choice, rock, paper, or scissors, and the result will appear.

If you both have picked the same thing, the score will be a tie. 

If rock and scissors is picked; rock wins.

If paper and rock is picked; paper wins.

If scissors and paper is picked; scissors wins.

You play for three rounds, whoever has won the most times in the three rounds, wins the entire game.

If you both tie all three times, no one wins.
